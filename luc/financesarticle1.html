                <p>What is budgeting and how do you do it? This article explores that question!</p>

                <h3>Introduction to budgeting</h3>
                <ul class="ingredients">
                   <p>What is budgeting and why is it worth my time? Allow me to explain it to you. Budgeting in simple terms is just managing your money by writing down your expenses and income and organizing them into different categories based on what these expenses are. 
                    Whether it is clothes, tuition, rent or whatever you might be spending your money on. 
                   </p>
                </ul>

                <!-- small header + paragraph -->
                <h3>How to make your budget</h3>
                <ul class="steps">
                    <p> Create a balance based on the things we just mentioned and your other expenses and income. After creating a balance you have a rough overview on how much money you earn and spend each month. What next? it's in the name, we create a budget. For example you earn 1700 euros monthly and spend 1600. 
                        First write down monthly expenses that are mandatory, rent and tuition for example. Let's say that it costs 600 euros per month in this example. 
                        After that that leaves you with money free to spend. roughly estimate how much you spend on what based on your balance of last month. groceries might cost you roughly 500 euros a month. 
                        its your choice to decide what your budget will be. stick to 500 euros for groceries and no more than that. Now do that with other categories you made. no more than 100 euros a month for outings. 
                        No more than 200 euros for clothes monthly. The list goes on. I can't tell you what your categories should look like because everyone has different priorities and spending habits. 
                    </p>
                </ul>

                <ul class="steps">
                    <p>
                        At the end of your budget list you should ideally have some money left for spending or saving. 
                        It is okay to have money left and is encouraged for a healthy way of handling money properly and to not go broke. 
                        I hope this explanation will help you manage your money better and reduce the burden of a limited budget.  
                        If you're still unsure there are plenty of examples and tutorials online!
