                <h2>Save Time with Meal Planning</h2>
                <img src="assets/images/meal-planning.jpg" alt="meal planning"/>
                <p class="paragraph one">Living yor life as a busy student, you wake up, have breakfast, attend classes, then eat lunch at the school 
                    cafeteria. Then as the day gets darker you started to think "What should I eat for dinner?", so you go to the 
                    kitchen, there's nothing ready to eat, you open your fridge but got confused of what to make, or worse, you ran 
                    out of ingredients. If you're somewhat experiencing this almost everyday in your life, then it's probably time 
                    for you to start planning your meals.
                    Meal planning can be a great way to save time, money, and make healthier food choices. However, we
                    know that most students are still inexperienced with this matter. But don't worry because we're here
                    to help you with that!
                    Here are some tips to help you with effective meal planning with these 3 simple steps:</p>
                    <ul class="steps">
                        <li>Choose your meals (and their recipes, if needed) for the week.</li>
                        <li>Shop for the ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Prepare the ingredients.</li>
                    </ul>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <h4>PRO TIP!</h4>
                    <p>Start planning on a Friday. shopping on Saturday morning (or night â€” less people in the stores), 
                    and then using an hour or so on Sunday for meal prep.</b></p>
                </div>

                <h3>1. Choosing your meals for the week</h3><br>
                <p class="paragraph">Consider your schedule, cooking skills, and dietary preferences when planning your meals. 
                Start with a manageable number of meals to plan per week. Have a look at your calendar for
                the coming week and decide on the days you want to cook. Five days is the most common
                denominator, but for some people 3 nights is the sweet spot.
                <br><br>
                Some important points to make note of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure that you choose meals that bless you with leftovers.</li>
                    <li>Choose recipes and meals that you already know how to make + 1 new recipe to keep
                        the boredom away.</li>
                    <li>Pick recipes based on what you commonly have in your pantry.</li>
                    <li>Only cook things you really want to eat.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="assets/images/shop.png" alt="shopping cart full of groceries in the middle of an aisle"/><br>
                <h3>2. Shopping for the ingredients</h3><br>
                <p class="paragraph">Before you start shopping, make sure to first make a master ingredient list!
                How to do so:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go through each recipe's ingredient list. Write down all the ingredients you'll need for the 
                        week, the list of ingredients will be your master ingredient list.</li>
                    <li>Now move along to your kitchen, and with your master ingredient list in hand, cross off what
                        you already have. Keep in mind the amount of each needed ingredient that you already have, 
                        make sure you have enough to make your meals. If you don't, keep the ingredient in the list.</li>
                    <li>Congratulations, now you have a grocery list, time to spend your money on some tasty ingredients!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Prepare the ingredients!</h3><br>
                <p class="paragraph">Meal plans? check. Ingredients? check. The next thing you should do is prepare the ingredients to be ready
                    for use for the whole week! Following the pro-tip given in the beginning of this blog, spare an hour or two 
                    on a Sunday especially for prepping the ingredients. What you should do depend on the recipes you have for
                    the week, but mincing garlic, dicing up onions, washing and chopping vegetables, and even pre-cooking some
                    meat in advanced is always a massive help.
