                <p>Groceries are expensive no matter how much money you make. And there is no way around it, 
                    these are daily necessities we need in order to survive. 
                    And to make it worse we're broke. 
                    So what is something you can do to make grocery shopping a little less expensive?

                <h3>A few ways to cut costs when grocery shopping</h3>
                <ul class="ingredients">
                   <p>Food prices have been rising in Europe the past few years and everyone is hurt by it. 
                    Especially people with lower incomes which so happens to include students. 
                    Here are some things you can do to find cheaper groceries:
                   </p>

                   <p>Use bonus cards/apps. 
                    Many chain supermarkets nowadays have apps or cards that let you access exclusive sales on many items. 
                    You can cut the costs by using these services, find out what app your local grocery store has and get yourself those sales. 
                    Registering is free so I would always suggest it. 
                   </p>

                   <p>Visit local grocery stores
                    And with local grocery stores I mean Turkish, Polish, Bulgarian and other various grocery stores that are family owned
                     or are not a chain grocery store so not, Albert Heijn, Jumbo, Lidl, Plus, you name it. 
                     Family owned stores usually have lower prices compared to the big stores. 
                     Except for things like meat. But vegetables especially are cheaper. 
                     They may look a little bit worse than the ones in Albert Heijn but they are just as healthy as any other. 
                     But in general these stores have cheaper prices. I would advise finding out the nearest of these in your local area and go look around. 
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    Cut out the unnecessary
                    This is probably the hardest one to accomplish fully. 
                    With unnecessary I mean snacks, candy and other things that aren't necessary. 
                    I'm not saying never buy yourself something nice and unhealthy but try to buy less if you see that it burns your wallet over time. 
                    But this also counts for meals. Bread, pasta, and rice is relatively cheap and lasts long. These are all highly customizable to your heart's extent. 
                    There are so many ways to prepare meals with these foods. 
                    See what works for you within your budget.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    These are but a few ways to save money while doing your grocery shopping.
