                <p>Many students in the Netherlands are from abroad and are from a completely different culture and way of living. 
                    This article is for these students so that they are a little more prepared for the coming years they will be spending here. 
                </p>

                <h3>Essentials if you live in the Netherlands</h3>
                <ul class="ingredients">
                   <p>
                   </p>

                   <p>The first obvious one is getting a bike. A bike here doesn't have to cost you more than 150 euros max. Look around on sites like Marktplaats for second hand bikes or see if your local bike shops have used bikes for sale. 
                    Many know this is the country of bicycles but it is for a reason. Infrastructure provides a safe network of bicycle routes that are faster than walking and even going by car. 
                    There is absolutely no reason to not buy yourself a bike while staying here.
                   </p>

                   <p>Paired with the bicycle are gloves and a sturdy umbrella. It gets windy and cold on a bike and it is not pleasant to cycle through without warm gloves around your hands. 
                    You might be cycling everyday. Investing in a good pair of gloves is almost invaluable. The effects of cycling with and without gloves are drastic. 
                    As you may have already noticed, weather in the Netherlands can be miserable with a lot of rain and cloudiness. 
                    That is why getting an umbrella is highly advised. Sure you can sit and wait the rain out. But sometimes that isn't an option. 
                    Especially in the Netherlands where it can rain the entire day. Getting an umbrella will make your life a little easier by leaving you a little less wet in the rain. 
                    But when I say sturdy umbrella I mean it. The wind during storms can break your umbrella if it isn't strong enough.  
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    An OV Chipkaart or a public transportation card is not necessary but super useful if you can apply for them. If you work for 32 hours or more in a month you may get a student travel product on Duo. In short, 
                    it allows you to use public transportation for free if you graduate within 6 years. 
                    If you think that is a realistic timeframe why not get yourself unlimited access to public transport? When applying you will be given the choice to pick between free weekends or free workdays. 
                    If you fail to get a diploma within 6 years you will have to pay back the travel product.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    I consider these few things as important but sometimes overlooked by many international students. 
                    Of course essential can be a hyperbolic term but many of the things in the list will improve your quality of life in the Netherlands.
                   </p>
